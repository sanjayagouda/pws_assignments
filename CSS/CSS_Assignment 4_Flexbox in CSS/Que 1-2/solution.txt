Q1 Sol: The key difference between the Flexbox and CSS Grid layout model lies in their layout strategies and how they handle the arrangement of elements:

Flexbox: It is primarily designed for one dimensional layouts, focusing on distributing space and aligning items along a single axis (either horizontally or vertically). It's best suited for layouts where you have a row or column of items, such as navigation menus, card-based designs or centering content within a container.

CSS Grid: It is designed for two-dimenstional layouts, allowing you to define both rows and columns. It creates a grid of cells where content can be placed in any cell or span across multiple cells. CSS Grid is ideal for complex grid-based designs like magazine layouts, forms and any layouts where content needs to placed in a precise grid structure.

Choosing between Flexbox and CSS Grid depends on your specific layout requirements.

You might choose Flexbox when you need to arrange items along a singke axis for exapmle when creating navigation bars, header/footer layouts or aligning elements within a container. Flexbox is great for resposive designs where items can vary in size.

You might choose CSS Grid when you need to create more complex, two-dimensional layouts with rows and columns. It's particularly useful when you have a grid like structure such as galleries, forms with multiple fields or any design that requires precise control over both rows and columns.

In some cases, you may even combine both Flexbox and CSS Grid within a single layout to leverage the strengths of each model for different parts of your webpage.


Q2 Sol: 

1. Justify-content: The justify content property in Flexbox is used to control the alignment of flex items along the main axis of the flex container. It determines how the extra space or insufficient space along the main axis is distributed. There are several values for justify-content including flex-start, flex-end, center, space-between, space evenly and space around.
For example: If you justify-content:center;, flex item will be aligned center along the main axis of the container. If you set justify-content: space-between; the first item will be aligned to the start, the last item to the end and the remaining space will be distributed evenly between the items.

2. align-item: The align-items property controls the alignment of flex items along the cross axis of the flex container. It specifies how items are positioned within their container along this axis. It accepts values such as flex-start, flex-end, center baseline and stretch.
For example: If you set align-items:center; flex items will be vertically centered within the container. If you set align-items:stretch; items will expand to fill the entire cross axis space of the container, ensuring they have the same height.

3. gap: The gap property is used to define the space between flex items in both directions, both along the main axis and the cross axis. It's often applied to the flex container itself. It simplifies spacing and creates consistent gaps between items without needing to appply margins to indivisual items.
For Example: If you set gap:20px; there will be a 20-pixel gap between adjacent flex items in both the horizontal and vertical directions, improving the overall spacing and alignment of items within the container.

4. flex-direction: The flex-direction property determines the direction in which flex items are placed within the flex container. It defines the main axis and consequently the layout flow. It can have values such as row, row-reverse, column and column-reverse.

5. flex-wrap: The flex-wrap property controls whether flex items are allowed to wrap onto multiple lines (new rows and columns) within the flex container when they don't fit along the main axis. It accepts values like nowrop, wrap and wrap-reverse.
For Example: If you set flex-wrap: wrap; flex items will wrap to the next line when there is not enough space in the current line, creating a multiline layout. flex-wrap is useful accomodating various screen sizes and orientations allowing items to adopt to different viewports and preventing content from getting cut off.

These properties play a critical role in creating well structured and visually pleasing layouts in flexbox, allowing you to control the positioning, alignment and spacing of flex items within a container.
